## A Standstill Problem
For the last couple of years, we’ve gone from horses to cars whose energy source is gasoline, and those were revolutionized when Tesla came out with electric cars, allowing the vehicle we drive in everyday to use a more sustainable energy source.

But, what about buildings? We’ve been living in multistory huts with windows for the last 2,000 years with innovations from steel and glass. Despite the inside being efficient, what about the outside? We need a new revolution so that buildings from the outside can optimize for better efficiency.

What do I mean by this? You’ve surely thought about how much energy a city uses. The obvious answer to this is buildings. Have you wondered how much energy exactly? Let’s break it down:

{{image:2}}

- As of 2022, the operations of buildings account for 30% of global final energy consumption and 26% of global energy-related emissions1 (8% being direct emissions in buildings and 18% indirect emissions from the production of electricity and heat used in buildings)

- Combined, space heating and lighting account for 55 to 60% of total building energy use.

- Buildings in the United States account for 826M of global CO2 emissions (2.04% globally) each year.

- Only 7% of energy used in buildings is renewable. Other 93% is natural gas and electricity generated from nuclear, natural gas and oil/coal.

This is a major problem. Only 7% of energy used is renewable. But why is this number so low? It’s due to the nature of buildings being in urban centers. Renewable energy sources are already a rare commodity, add on the fact that most, if not all require a great deal of land space - which is just unaffordable in a city. So what can we do about this? Powering the building through its windows.

The next step for buildings is to take advantage of existing infrastructure. What we’ve been looking at, literally, this whole time. Currently, windows do a very poor job of insulating.

- <u>[30%](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-window-coverings#:~:text=About%2030%25%20of%20a%20home's,temperatures%2C%20and%20lowering%20energy%20bills.)</u> of a home's heating energy is lost through windows.

- In cooling seasons, about <u>[76%](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-window-coverings#:~:text=About%2030%25%20of%20a%20home's,temperatures%2C%20and%20lowering%20energy%20bills.)</u> of sunlight that falls on standard double-pane windows enters to become heat.

Now don’t just take my word for the possibility of this. Would you believe me if I told you the windows are powering the lights in the building from the image below?

It’s true!

This isn’t a new concept, however this pilot project from 2021 out of Michigan State University has finally put years of theory into practice. What is this technology? Well let’s talk.

### The Solution: “Tinted” Electricity Generating Windows
Our solution involves capturing the light from the sun at the infrared part of the spectrum while utilizing a double paned argon gas style glass for increased insulation. Let me explain. Quantum dots have the ability to allow our windows to be translucent or transparent by tuning - meaning absorbing different wavelengths of light. Why is this important? The sun’s rays shine across the electromagnetic wave spectrum.

54% of the heat related to the sun’s light also comes from the infrared spectrum, a spectrum we can’t see with our own eyes. By tuning the quantum dots, they have the ability to capture these infrared waves while leaving the window transparent.

So what does this look like?

{{image:5}}
Like most windows currently in use, we’ll be using a double paned glass strategy. There are some differences - one outside pane and one inside plane containing the quantum dot technology. In between the panes of glass is argon gas for added thermal insulation. It is found to be 16% more efficient than air. Why do we need argon? Heat can be transferred through a window via convection. This effect is reduced by using argon gas.

The ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) layer is used as a broader encapsulant for the entire cell assembly, providing mechanical protection, adhesion, and an additional environmental barrier. 

The transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer is Indium Tin Oxide. This layer serves as one of the electrodes, collecting the electrons or holes. It must be conductive while being transparent to allow sunlight to pass through. It also sandwiches the quantum dot layer and is responsible for charge collection and transport.

## The Basics: Quantum Dot Technology in Solar Cells
At their core, quantum dots are incredibly tiny semiconductor particles, so tiny that they exhibit quantum mechanical properties. They are composed of materials from the groups of II+VI, III+V, or IV+VI.

Some examples are cadmium telluride (cadmium from group II and tellurium from group VI) and indium phosphide (indium from group III and phosphorus from group V)in the periodic table.

The structure of quantum dots is also an important property.

1. **Core:** This is the main body of the quantum dot, made from semiconductor materials. The core is where electron-hole pairs (excitons) are generated when the QD absorbs light.

2. **Shell** (often present, but not always): Many quantum dots are coated with a shell of another semiconductor material. For instance, a Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum dot might be coated with a Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) shell. The shell can provide several benefits: 

    a. *Protection:* It can protect the sensitive core from environmental factors.

    b. *Enhanced Efficiency:* By confining the electron and hole to the core, the shell can reduce non-radiative recombination and improve the quantum efficiency.

    c. *Tuning Properties:* The properties of the quantum dot (like its emission wavelength) can be adjusted by altering the shell's thickness or material.

Quantum dots (QDs) mainly work by capturing light from the electromagnetic spectrum and storing it for release at a later time. They measure 2 -10 nanometers in diameter (that's billions of times smaller than a meter). Due to their extremely small size, QDs have unique electronic and optical properties that differ from those of larger particles. These properties can be 'tuned' or adjusted by changing the size of the quantum dots. This trait, combined with their capability to interact with light in distinct ways, positions them as a revolutionary tool in sectors ranging from electronics to medicine. Now, when diving into the technical aspects of quantum dots, especially in solar technology, their size-tunable band gaps, and the resultant adaptability to absorb varying wavelengths of sunlight, truly stand out.

Tunability and the Size-Dependent Band Gap: One of the most remarkable properties of quantum dots is their size-dependent band gap. Essentially, the band gap is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. This is crucial because the band gap determines the energy (or color) of light a semiconductor can absorb. In the realm of quantum dots, by simply tweaking the size of the dot, one can change its band gap.

At the heart of any semiconductor's electronic properties lies the concept of the band gap. This gap is essentially an energy barrier that prevents electrons in the valence band (the semiconductor's ground state) from jumping to the conduction band (where electrons can move freely and conduct electricity). The width of this gap, or its energy difference, dictates the energy of photons the material can absorb, and thus the color or wavelength of light it responds to.

This results in a unique ability to 'tune' the electronic properties of the quantum dot. As a result, smaller quantum dots are more sensitive to higher energy light, specifically those from the blue spectrum, whereas larger dots might absorb lower energy light like reds or infrareds.

When a photon is absorbed by any semiconductor, including quantum dots, it injects energy into the system. This energy promotes an electron from its resting state in the valence band, to the conduction band. This upward jump of the electron creates a vacancy in the valence band, often referred to as a 'hole'. Together, the free-moving electron in the conduction band and the hole in the valence band constitute an electron-hole pair, or exciton. The magic in quantum dots is their ability to create multiple excitons from a single photon and the subsequent potential to harness these excitons efficiently for solar energy conversion.

## What's Currently Being Done:
**Traditional Solar**: <u>[45%](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/solar-pv)</u> of total global electricity generation investment in 2022. That’s 3x more than the investment on all fossil fuel technologies combined. Crystalline polysilicon remains the leading solar technology, with decades of development, it’s reached an efficiency of around 31%. Solar

**Pilot Projects**: Many startups have incorporated pilot projects. Such as the Michigan State University example in collaboration with <u>[Ubiquitous Energy](https://www.dezeen.com/2022/09/16/ubiquitous-energy-aims-transparent-solar-windows-global-standard/)</u>.

**Combination**: Some startups and researchers are experimenting with integrating quantum dot technology into traditional silicon solar technology. So far, the power conversion has reached <u>[10.4%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01362-1)</u>.

## Our Differentiator
**Light Fusion**: Traditional solar cells have an inherent limitation - they can't utilize photons with energies below their bandgap, often wasting a significant portion of the sun's energy. Enter the concept of light fusion, also known as photochemical upconversion. In this process, two or more low-energy photons are absorbed and effectively 'merged' to produce a single higher-energy photon. This is achieved using molecules known as sensitizers and emitters. Sensitizers absorb the low-energy photons and transfer this energy to the emitters, which then emit a photon with combined energy. This upconverted photon, with its higher energy, can then be absorbed and converted into electricity by the solar cell. Thus, light fusion allows solar cells to tap into a wider range of the solar spectrum, enhancing their overall efficiency.

**Efficiency Benchmarks**: The quest for improved solar cell efficiency is never-ending. Quantum-dot solar cells have emerged as potential game-changers in this arena. Thermodynamic analyses, carried out in meticulous detail, have revealed something astonishing: under conditions of concentrated sunlight, quantum-dot solar cells can potentially reach conversion efficiencies as high as 66%. This is staggering, double the efficiency of the current solar benchmark.

### What Are Current Limitations?
**Efficiency**: While quantum dot solar technology does promise great efficiencies, as high as 66%, the technology is still in research and development. Therefore, more resources must be invested for it to reach a stage where it can compete with traditional solar.

**Scalability**: Along with quantum dots being in solar technology being in an r&d phase. Scaling this technology to a large scale has not been completed yet due to it’s small size and difficulty to manufacture.

**Stability**: Quantum dots, particularly InP, can be sensitive to degradation when exposed to air or moisture. Even with encapsulation, ensuring the long-term stability of quantum dots in a window environment can be challenging.

**TCO Limitations**: Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is a common TCO but comes with its own set of challenges:

- Scarcity: Indium is a relatively rare metal, making ITO expensive (and makes indium phosphide expensive as well).

- Brittleness: ITO can be brittle, which might pose challenges in terms of mechanical stability for windows that need to be durable.

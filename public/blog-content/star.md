I’d never really thought much about fusion to be honest. To me, it was just a buzz word thrown around in school that sounded cool. A way of producing energy? Sure… did someone connected it to stars?

Why am I telling you this? Well I recently took a dive down a rabbit hole into the world of fusion. And let me tell you - it doesn’t just sound cool, it’s freaking insane.

Maybe you’ve heard of fusion before. What is it? We’ll discuss fusion, the technical details, how we’ll achieve it, challenges, and it’s application through the lens of a startup, <u>[Helion Energy](https://www.helionenergy.com/technology/)</u>.

## Superstar Potential
Let’s do a comparison of the potential energy output for fusion vs other renewable sources.

- *Fusion*: From a gram of deuterium-tritium fuel (yes a single gram), it can produce the same amount of energy as 2400 gallons of oil which is approximately 105 megawatts.

- *Solar*: On average, solar panels have an efficiency of 15-20%, producing about 0.0002 megawatts per square meter under optimal conditions.

- *Wind*: A modern wind turbine, depending on its size and air conditions, can produce between 2 to 5 MW of power. However, the capacity factor (actual output) is typically 20-40%, given that wind is not constant.

- *Hydropower*: Large hydropower plants can produce up to several thousand megawatts of power, but this heavily depends on the water flow and height of the reservoir.

Fusion is also a renewable energy source. It produces zero carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases at any stage of energy generation. Just for comparison:

- *Coal*: Burning coal is one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions globally. On average, coal-fired power plants emit around 2.2 lbs of carbon dioxide for every kWh produced.

- *Natural Gas*: Natural gas plants emit 0.92 lbs of CO2 per kWh, which is better than coal but still significant.

- *Oil*: Emissions can vary, but oil-fired power plants release about 1.7 lbs of CO2 per kWh.

Keep in mind that fusion does have emissions tied to manufacturing, installation and transportation, but so does every other renewable energy source.

In summary, fusion has the potential for a tremendous amount of energy output with a significantly reduced carbon footprint. Did I catch your attention?

## The Science of Star Power

Why the heck do I keep talking about stars? Well have you ever thought about how a star generates energy? Fusion! At the core of a star, nuclear fusion constantly occurs fusing hydrogen into helium. This process causes an enormous energy release. It relies on the tremendous heat (around 10,000,000 degrees celcius!) as well as immense pressures to fuse the hydrogen. These are the two critical factors involved in fusion.

A more technical definition according to the international atomic energy agency: *“Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier one while releasing massive amounts of energy. Fusion reactions take place in a state of matter called plasma — a hot, charged gas made of positive ions and free-moving electrons that has unique properties distinct from solids, liquids and gases.”*

Confused? Alright, alright, I was too. I’ll give you an example:

Imagine you’re cooking chicken and peppers, two ingredients that maybe taste great by themselves (the elements such as hydrogen, deuterium or helium-3). But, throw them together (similar to fusion in the way they get forced together)… and bam, a magical release of taste + smell (the resulting electricity).

Now, I don’t want you to think this is lightwork… there’s a reason why fusion isn’t fully sustainable yet. There are a few requirements. Unlike the sun which can achieve fusion at its core at a temperature above the 10 million degrees celcius mark, we simply can’t because it’s impossible to replicate the immense pressure from the sun’s gravitational force.

On earth, these are the factors currently preventing us from achieving fusion:

We need to sustain temperatures of at least 100 million degrees celcius while sustaining high pressure. Those temperatures are being reached routinely in experiments, but there are some other limiting factors.

We need sufficient confinement to hold the plasma and be able to maintain the fusion reaction long enough for a net power gain.

## Defying the Status Quo: Helion Energy

Remember at the very start when I said I took a dive down a rabbit hole, well Helion was actually the reason. By investigating Helion, I was able to get a general sense of the fusion space and understand the major players involved.

What is Helion Energy?

Helion was started in 2013 with the goal of creating the first fusion reactor. They are developing a magneto-inertial fusion technology to produce helium-3 and fusion power via aneutronic fusion. They’ve shipped 6 prototypes in the past 7 years (super fast!), with each being closer to Q>1 than the last (we haven’t reached Q>1 yet). Recently, they’ve raised a series E fund of 2.2 billion led by Sam Altman, Peter Thiel and many more notable names. They also have a deal to provide Microsoft with fusion energy by 2028! That was a handful, so let’s break it down.

What is magneto-inertial fusion? It’s a combination of magnetic and inertial confinement.

**Magnetic Confinement**: This approach uses strong magnetic fields to confine the hot fusion plasma. The most common example of this is the Tokamak.

**Inertial Confinement**: Here, fusion fuel is rapidly heated and compressed by external means, such as lasers or ion beams.

**Magneto-Inertial**: Taking the best of both worlds. The idea is to compress a magnetized target, using techniques similar to inertial confinement. The magnetic fields inside the target can help reduce thermal losses and assist in confining the plasma as it is compressed. Because the plasma is both magnetically confined and rapidly compressed (like in inertial confinement), the conditions for fusion can potentially be achieved with a combination of fewer magnetic fields than pure magnetic confinement and less compression than pure inertial confinement. <u>[Learn more here](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2229/ML22290A236.pdf)</u>.

What is Q? That’s just the fusion energy gain factor. Q>1 means you got more energy from the reaction than what you put in. Q=1 means breakeven and Q<1… you get it.

Why the heck did I choose Helion of all the startups and massive projects? Well they’re building a small scale fusion reactor. About the size of a shipping container. Now you might be saying to yourself, that is still massive. Yes is it. But when you compare it to the leading fusion reactor project globally - International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which is the size of 60 full sized soccer fields… then you really notice that Helion’s reactor is tiny.

As mentioned earlier, Helion is using magneto-inertial confinement to produce fusion. <u>[Here’s how their reactor works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlNfP3iywvI)</u>

I mentioned ITER earlier, the leading fusion reactor project globally. It’s projected to receive 45 billion in funding upon completion, as well as have the involvement of 500 companies and 35 countries. It also uses the current most popular design for a fusion reactor - a tokamak. A tokamak uses the traditional magnetic confinement technique.

<u>[Here’s how ITER’s design works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tH4obUsY64)</u>

With all that funding, parties involved, and a stellar design, what gives Helion an edge?

1. Size. Helion’s reactor being smaller allows for a reduced cost and complexity to manufacture - thus the 6 prototypes in 7 years.

2. Field Reversed Configuration. By using field reversed configuration plasmas (a rather new approach), a more mobile approach can be made. Meaning, the plasmas can be moved from the production location to the fusion chamber which prevents the hot plasmas from damaging certain equipment.

3. Modular Design. The reactor design is modular. This allows it to be scaled up to provide flexibility in power production and potentially lead to more manageable capital costs and construction timelines.

Now it isn’t all fun and games. There is also a major downside to Helion’s design.

1. The Fuel. Helion uses a field reversed configuration along with deuterium and helium-3. Compared to ITER, which uses the most common fuel type of deuterium and tritium. However, deuterium and helium-3 is much less reactive than deuterium and tritium. Almost 1000x less reactive at 100 million degrees celsius. To reach a point where it is only 50x less reactive, we’d need to heat it to 600 million degrees celsius, a very challenging feat.

Lastly, let’s talk about Helion’s goals.

Achieving Q>1 (net positive energy return) by 2024. Pretty straightforward. Researchers at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California achieved breakeven, a Q value of 1.5. ITER’s design has the goal of reaching at least Q>10.

A fully functioning fusion plant by 2028. This is extremely ambitious. All other competitors have goals of a functioning plant by the 2030s. Their fully functioning plant plans to generate 50 megawatts a year, which could support 40,000 homes. In comparison, a US natural gas plant generates well over 500 megawatts a year. However, this is just the beginning of fusion energy.

Lowering electricity cost to 1 cent per kilowatt hour. For perspective, the average electricity cost in Canada is 17 cents per kilowatt hour and in the United States is 24 cents. This is at least a 15-20x improvement.

## To Infinity and Beyond
From rising energy demands, to rising sea levels, our future invites a plethora of issues. Fusion could be the key to removing major bottlenecks and pushing humanity forward.

Imagine large-scale desalination plants powered by fusion, turning vast amounts of seawater into drinkable resources, directly addressing water scarcity in arid regions. This isn't just theoretical - the primary hindrance to large-scale desalination has been the tremendous energy requirement, a challenge fusion is well equipped to tackle.

Furthermore, carbon capture technologies, which directly pull CO2 from our atmosphere, have been held back by their energy-intensiveness. Fusion could very well be the key that unlocks the large-scale deployment of these technologies, turning the tables in our favor in the fight against global warming.

Beyond these applications, industries with traditionally large carbon footprints, from manufacturing to transportation, stand to be revolutionized by the clean, abundant energy fusion promises. This isn't just about lowering emissions but actively reversing some of the damages we've inflicted on our planet.

Collaborations will be central to this fusion-powered future. Visionaries in fusion research, like Helion Energy, are prime candidates for partnerships with environmental tech firms, pioneering efforts in water treatment, habitat restoration, and carbon capture.

In conclusion, as we stand at the cusp of significant breakthroughs in fusion technology, we're not just looking at a future with cleaner energy. We're envisioning a world where our most pressing environmental challenges are not just halted but actively reversed, all thanks to the immense power fusion offers.

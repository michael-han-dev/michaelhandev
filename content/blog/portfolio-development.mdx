# Portfolio Development

Building this portfolio website from scratch has been both challenging and rewarding.

## Tech Stack

I chose a modern stack for this project:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **MDX** for blog content

## Design Decisions

The design follows these principles:
- **Minimalism**: Clean, white background with plenty of space
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy using Geist Sans and Instrument Serif
- **Animation**: Subtle motion to enhance user experience
- **Responsiveness**: Works great on all device sizes

## Features Implemented

✅ Responsive design  
✅ Blog with MDX support  
✅ Project showcase  
✅ GitHub activity chart  
✅ Social media links  
✅ Smooth animations  

## What I Learned

This project taught me about:
- Advanced Next.js patterns
- Animation principles  
- Content management with MDX
- Clean code architecture

Building your own portfolio is one of the best ways to learn and showcase your skills!
